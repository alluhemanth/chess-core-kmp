/**
 * The File class represents a column on a chessboard, ranging from 'a' to 'h'. It provides methods for
 * manipulating and querying file values, converting them to array indices, and performing arithmetic operations.
 *
 * ## Overview
 * - A file is represented by a single character ('a' to 'h').
 * - Provides utility methods for arithmetic operations, comparisons, and conversions.
 *
 * ### Arithmetic Operations
 * - **Addition:** You can add an integer to a file, resulting in a new file shifted by the given amount.
 * - **Subtraction:** You can subtract an integer from a file, resulting in a new file shifted by the given amount.
 * - These operations are useful for calculating neighboring files or iterating over files programmatically.

 * ### Conversion
 * - **To Array Index:** The [toArrayIndex] method converts the file to a zero-based index (0 for 'a', 7 for 'h').
 * - This is useful for accessing arrays or lists that represent chessboard rows or columns.

 * ### Example Usage
 * ```Kotlin
 * val file = File('e')
 * val nextFile = file + 1 // File('f')
 * val index = file.toArrayIndex() // 4
 * val isEqual = file.isEqualTo('e') // true
 * ```
 *
 * @property value The character representing the file ('a' to 'h').
