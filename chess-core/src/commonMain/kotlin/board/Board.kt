/**
 * The Board class represents the positions of pieces on a chessboard at a specific moment. It tracks which [Piece]
 * occupies each of the 64 squares, if any. This class focuses solely on the arrangement of pieces and provides methods
 * for querying and updating positions, applying moves to generate new board configurations, and accessing pieces by
 * square or algebraic notation. It does not track additional game state details such as castling rights, en passant
 * targets, or move history.
 *
 * ## Overview
 * - Each square is uniquely identified by its [File] (column) and [Rank] (row).
 * - The board state is internally managed using a mutable map, allowing efficient access and updates.
 * - The class supports algebraic notation (e.g., "e4") for intuitive square referencing.
 * - Special chess rules such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion are handled seamlessly.
 *
 * ## Internal Implementation Details
 * ### Board State Storage
 * The board state is stored in a `MutableMap<Square, Piece?>` called `squaresMap`.
 * Each key is a [Square] (which combines a [File] and [Rank]), and the value is either a [Piece] (if a piece occupies
 * that square) or `null` (if the square is empty). All 64 squares are always present as keys in the map.
 *
 * ### Access Patterns
 * - **By Square:** You can access or modify a square directly using the [Square] object.
 * - **By File and Rank:** Overloaded operators allow access via [File] and [Rank] parameters.
 * - **By Algebraic Notation:** You can use algebraic notation (e.g., `"e4"`) to get or set a piece, which is internally
 * converted to a [Square].
 *
 * ### Manipulation
 * - **Setting a Piece:** Assigning a [Piece] (or `null`) to a square updates the corresponding entry in `squaresMap`.
 *
 * - **Applying Moves:** The [applyMove] method creates a deep copy of the board, applies the move (including special
 * rules like promotion, en passant, and castling), and returns the new board.
 *
 * - **Immutability:** Although `squaresMap` is mutable for internal convenience, the class is designed to be used
 * immutably: most operations return a new `Board` instance, preserving the original.
 *
 * - **Copying:** The [copy] method creates a deep copy of the board and all pieces, ensuring no shared mutable state
 * between board instances.
 *
 * ### Example of Internal Access
 * ```
 * // Access by file and rank
 * val piece = board[File('e'), Rank(4)]
 * // Set by square
 * board[Square("e4")] = Piece(PieceType.QUEEN, PieceColor.WHITE)
 * // Access by algebraic notation
 * val pawn = board["e2"]
 * ```
 *
 * ### Usage Example
 * ```Kotlin
 * // Initializing a chess board and applying a move
 * val board = Board.initialBoard()
 * val move = Move("e2","e4")
 * val newBoard = board.applyMove(move)
 * ```
 *
 * @property squaresMap A mutable map from [Square] to [Piece?], representing the current state of the board.
