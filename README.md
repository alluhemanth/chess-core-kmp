# chess-core-kmp
A Kotlin Multiplatform library for handling chess rules, move generation, and game state management â€” designed
for flexibility, extensibility, and integration with engines like Stockfish.

## Features
- **Complete Chess Logic:** Implements all standard chess rules, including castling, en passant, promotion, and draw
  conditions (threefold repetition, fifty-move rule, insufficient material).
- **FEN and PGN Support:** Easily load and export games using standard Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) and Portable Game
  Notation (PGN).
- **Move Generation:** Efficiently generates legal moves for any given position.
- **Extensible Design:** The project is structured to be easily extended with new features or integrations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Gradle

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alluhemanth/chess-core-kmp.git
   ```
2. Build the project using Gradle:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

### Using as a Dependency (via Maven Central)

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.alluhemanth:chess-core:1.0.1")
}
```

## ChessGame API

The `ChessGame` class provides a complete chess game implementation, including board state management, move generation,
and game logic. Below is an overview of its key methods and usage.

```kotlin
val game = ChessGame()

game.makeSanMove("e4")
game.makeSanMove("e5")

game.makeUciMove("e2e4")
game.makeUciMove("e7e5")

val move = game.getLegalMoves().first()
game.makeMove(move)

game.undo()
game.redo()

game.getBoard()
game.getCurrentPlayer()
game.isGameOver()

val result = game.getGameResult()

val legalMoves = game.getLegalMoves()

game.getFen()
game.loadFen("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1")

val pgn = game.getPgn()
game.loadPgn("1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6")
```

## Project Structure

- `src/commonMain/kotlin`: Contains the core source code for the chess engine.
    - `board`: Classes related to the chessboard, squares, files, and ranks.
    - `exception`: Custom exceptions for handling errors.
    - `game`: Game state management, rules, and results.
    - `move`: Move generation and representation.
    - `piece`: Piece types, colors, and representation.
    - `utils`: Utilities for handling FEN, PGN, and SAN (Standard Algebraic Notation).
- `src/test/kotlin`: Contains unit tests for the project.
